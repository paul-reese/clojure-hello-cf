# hello-cf

A Clojure RESTful Web Service that can be deployed to Cloud Foundry using a Heroku Clojure or Java Buildpack. This project is taken from [Matt Stine's Clojure Blog] (http://www.mattstine.com/2013/05/29/clojure-on-cloud-foundry/).


## Pre-requisites

To use this project to push the support Clojure RESTful application to Cloud Foundry the user must;
* [Download and Install Cloud Foundry CLI] ()
* [Install Lein] (http://leiningen.org/#install "for Mac OSX")

## Enable Clojure App for Cloud Foundry

To enable this Clojure application to run in Cloud Foundry a Profile was created in the root directory containing this snippit
    
    web: lein with-profile production trampoline run -m hello-cf.core $PORT

## Create an Uberjar

If you'd like to fork and make changes one would need to create an uberjar using the lein command
    
    lein uberjar

The necessary artifacts (including a standalone JAR file) will be created
    
    $ ls -ltr target                                                                                                                        1 â†µ

## Usage

### To run locally

    % lein trampoline run -m hello-cf.core 8080

Application will retrieve its dependencies

    Retrieving environ/environ/1.0.3/environ-1.0.3.pom from clojars
    Retrieving ring/ring-devel/1.4.0/ring-devel-1.4.0.pom from clojars
    Retrieving ring/ring-core/1.4.0/ring-core-1.4.0.pom from clojars

User only needs to open 0.0.0.0:8080 in a browser or execute a curl GET aginast the endpoint

    Hello people, this is a Clojure app running with java buildpack!   

### To run on Cloud Foundry

There are two Cloud Foundry manifest files provided;

* manifest.yml - supports using a Heroku Clojure OSS buildpack
* manifest-java.yml - supports using the Java OSS buildpack

To cf push application using Heroku Clojure Buildpack

    % cf push -f manifest.yml

    Using manifest file manifest.yml
